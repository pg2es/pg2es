#### It's usable, but do not expect to much
The tool is quite straightforward, designed mostly for 1:1 match between table and document.
However, there are few tricks up it's sleeve.


Features:
* Field renaming
* Field ignoring
* Table inlining (scripted 1:N)
* Table routing
* Join via join field. (static and polymorphic)
* Configurable document `_id`
* (planned) template fields
* (planned) multi-column PKs

Feel free to request additional features.
